# Predicting-Diabetes-using-Multiple-Machine-Learning-Models.


**Introduction to the Project:**

The project revolves around the critical healthcare challenge of predicting diabetes. The dataset used for this purpose includes various diagnostic measurements, such as the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and age. The target variable, 'Outcome', indicates whether the patient has diabetes. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine the presence or absence of diabetes based on these health indicators.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

The initial dataset contained some zero values in features where zero does not make sense (like Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI). These were considered as missing data and were replaced with NaN. Then, these missing values were filled with the mean of the respective column. This is a common strategy for handling missing data and ensures that the model isn't trained on misleading data. The dataset was then split into features (X) and the target variable (y), and further split into training and test sets. This is a crucial step for training and evaluating your machine learning model.

**Data Visualization with Seaborn:**

Data visualization is a key aspect of any data analysis process. It helps in understanding the data better and drawing insights. In this project, various visualization techniques were used. Box plots provided a statistical summary of the distribution of each feature. Histograms provided a graphical representation of the frequency distribution of each feature. A heatmap was used to visualize the correlation between different features. A pair plot provided a visual overview of the relationships between different diagnostic measurements. Each of these visualizations offers a different perspective on the data and helps in understanding the relationships between the features.

**Insightful Analysis:**

The analysis revealed that the dataset is imbalanced, with more patients who don’t have diabetes than those who do. This could potentially affect the performance of the predictive model. The correlation heatmap showed a high correlation between the ‘Outcome’ and the features ‘Glucose’, ‘BMI’, ‘Age’, and ‘Insulin’. These features could be particularly important when building the predictive model. This analysis helps in understanding which features are most important for predicting diabetes and how they interact with each other.

**Machine Learning Model Development:**

From our conversation, we've discussed the following key points:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model**: We've discussed how to train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for predicting diabetes based on various health parameters. The model was trained and its performance was evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

2. **Model Prediction**: We've created a function `predict_diabetes` that takes a trained model and uses it to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on their health parameters. The function prompts the user to enter their health parameters, preprocesses the input data, and uses the model to make a prediction.

3. **Model Saving and Loading**: We've discussed how to save a trained model to a file and then load it back into memory using the `pickle` module in Python. This allows us to reuse the model without having to retrain it every time.

4. **Model Performance**: We've discussed potential reasons why the model might not be making accurate predictions, such as issues with the model's performance, the quality of the data, the importance of the features, and the limitations of the KNN algorithm.

5. **Improving Model Performance**: We've discussed several strategies for improving the model's performance, including checking the data, checking the model, tuning the model, and handling class imbalance.
 
Several machine learning models were trained on the data, including a Support Vector Classifier, a Bagging Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and a Random Forest Classifier. The models were evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix. The K-Nearest Neighbors model achieved the highest accuracy of 78.57%. This step is crucial in determining which model performs best on the given data.

**Model Persistence and Deployment:**

A function was created to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on their health measurements. This function takes in the health measurements as input, preprocesses the input data, uses the trained model to make predictions, and returns the prediction. This function can be used to make predictions in a real-world setting.

**Specific Data Processing Steps:**

The data processing steps involved replacing zero values with NaN for certain features, filling these missing values with the mean of the respective column, splitting the dataset into features and the target variable, further splitting these into training and test sets, and standardizing the features. Each of these steps is crucial in preparing the data for training a machine learning model.

**Data Exploration and Visualization:**

Data exploration involved calculating the mean of all the features for diabetic and non-diabetic people separately. Data visualization involved creating box plots, histograms, a pair plot, and a heatmap of correlation between different features. Each of these steps helps in understanding the data better and drawing insights.

**Conclusion:**

The project successfully developed a predictive model for diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. The K-Nearest Neighbors model achieved the highest accuracy. The project demonstrated the importance of data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization in developing a predictive model.

**Future Work:**

Future work could involve trying out more machine learning models, tuning the hyperparameters of the models more extensively, and addressing the class imbalance in the dataset. Additionally, more features could be engineered and the current features could be analyzed more deeply for better insights. This would help in improving the performance of the predictive model and making it more robust.
